# The Random Bot
Hello, and welcome to the GitHub page for the Random Bot. If you're curious as to what all it does, I will include sections that describe the different aspects of the bot.


### The Random Commands
There are 5 random commands for right now:
##### Article
 - This gives you a random wikipedia article with a title, summary, and url
##### Number
 - This gives you a number from a min/max that you **must** provide or the bot will give an error
##### Video
 - This gives you a random video from YouTube
##### Color
 - This gives you a random color w/ Hex and RGB formatting (might add CMYK for the kicks)
##### Song
 - This gives you a random song from the top 50 songs of the top 50 tags of last.fm
##### Random
 - This gives you a random item from one of the previously listed generators

### Ping
This is self-explanatory really. It just provides you the bot's latency.

### Roadmap:
- [x] Incorporate a homebrew Random Wikipedia Article generator
- [x] Include a basic random number generator
- [x] Include a ping command that displays the bot's latency
- [x] Add a random YouTube video generator
- [x] Added a new random color feature
- [x] Streamlined the Help command in order to ensure legibility
- [x] Added a few developer-only commands
- [x] Added a random song generator
- [ ] Maybe add a random Urban Dictionary definition for channels marked nsfw(?)
- [ ] Add a r/all puller for only channels marked nsfw (with a possibility for ignoring nsfw posts in sfw channels)

#### Are you curious as to how I made this?
It's simple! All I used was discord.py with a random wiki article generator I made previously and built on it from there!
