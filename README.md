# The Random Bot
Hello, and welcome to the GitHub page for the Random Bot. If you're curious as to what all it does, I will include sections that describe the different aspects of the bot.


<h3>The Random Commands</h3>
There are 2 random commands for right now:
- article - gives you a random wikipedia article with a title, summary, and url
- number - this gives you a number from a min/max that you **must** provide or the bot will give an error

<h3>Ping</h3>
This is self-explanatory really. It just provides you the bot's latency.

<h4>Roadmap:</h4>
- [x] Incorporate the Random Wikipedia Article generator
- [x] Include a basic random number generator
- [x] Include a ping command that displays the bot's latency
- [ ] Add a random YouTube video generator
- [ ] Maybe add a random Urban Dictionary definition for channels marked nsfw(?)

<h5>Are you curious as to how I made this?</h5>
It's simple! All I used was discord.py with a random wiki article generator I made previously and built on it from there!
